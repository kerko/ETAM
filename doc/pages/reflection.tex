\chapter{Reflection}
The development of our text adventure maker went very flawless. We didn't have much complications. Working with an advanced version control like git sure help speed things up. Also we created a really strong API Design that didn't needed much changes. Creating the XML standard for our system was a little bit hard because we're missing some comfort functions we thought XML would have, like referencing and stuff. In the end we finished almost everything we wanted to do in project's limited time frame. We're proud of what we achieved so far and intend to improve and use EPIC in the future for personal projects.

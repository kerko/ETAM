\chapter{Introduction}

Text adventures can be the most powerful game experience on earth, because you're able to create all graphics, events and sounds in your head. You type in commands and the game reacts. Sometimes events happen, a troll may attack you suddenly or you find mighty items in order to improve your hero. 

We wanted to offer a fast and easy way to everyone,with basic programming knowledge, to create text adventures with not more than a simple XML File and a little bit of Java code.  An API and a XML parsing/IO package were the way to go.  Anyone interested now just needs to create his own game logic and XML File to create a fully working text adventure.

We also wanted to make it possible to create the game without a need to worry about all the game logic behind the little things in the game. Therefore we provided a simple implementation of our API, which can be used to make the first steps with \textbf{EPIC}

For this project we decided to use a GIT repository over an SVN repository because of the superior performance and powerful features of GIT. Also we wanted to broaden our knowledge in this new technology.

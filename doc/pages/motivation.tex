\chapter{Motivation}
This document is part of the FND 2 course at Fontys Hogeshool Venlo, especially the XML-Project.
We choose the text adventure case and were presented with the work from students of the previous year. .
The first attempt was to improve the existing version of \textbf{Extreme text adventure}. After we read the minimalistic documentation it was our aim not only to improve the software - we wanted to introduce a more generic way of making text adventures.\\

We decided to create a tool to generate text adventures by taking a XML file into account. In the following we explain, how we the generator named \textbf{EPIC} works, what we implemented and whats coming in the future.

This document should help anyone interested in our work to understand what we did, why we did it and who we managed certain problems.

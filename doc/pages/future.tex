\chapter{Look into the future}
Our system supports a basic text adventure as of now. We have rooms, creatures, items and moving and fighting. It's basically everything you would need for a simple text adventure.

 In the future we would do some optimizing of the code to make it perform more efficiently and maybe faster.
Also we would like to support more different item types and various effects that come with them. 
Also we planned to do triggers which can be used to give the game a more dynamic feel.  
In the far future we also would do a more complex version of the combat system. Right now its basically just; you hit something and if its not dead its hits back.
